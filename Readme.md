# Pivot Farmer for Neural Cloud
## WARNING
I made this for me if it works for you great.

This is not a user friendly script.  
More than likely your gonna have to edit the main file.  
Ideally the WIDTH of your emulator should be 1080p, yes the width, got an ultrawide set vertically so thats what im using.  
This uses adb for input so you can still use you computer without you mouse being hijacked.
The window still needs to be visible you cant minimize it.  
## How to run
```console
python main.py -p adb_port
```
